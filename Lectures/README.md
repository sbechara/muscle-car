# Muscle Car Lectures

This folder contains PDF files that you can use to base your muscle car lectures off of.

## Hints / Best Practices

When using these lectures, keep in mind the following:

* Do not spend more than 30 minutes *maximum* at any time lecturing. Lecturing is useful to disseminate information but it is **boring**. Therefore you should only do it in bursts.
* Use these lectures as a guide but it is highly reccomended that you *make your own lectures*. Lecturing is very individual and students will be able to tell that this isn't your material.
