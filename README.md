# The Muscle Car Open Source Summer Camp Project

The Muscle Car is an open-source camp that provides an interactive introduction to electronic prototyping and human physiology. The camp is centered on designing, building, and testing an electromyogram and radio controlled (eRC) car. The camp is open-source and all of the materials developed are free for use and modification with very few restrictions.

### Goals

There are two goals with the camp 

1. To create an engaging and fun camp that encourages middle school and high school students to pursue STEM careers. 

2. To leverage the open-source nature of the camp to create a platform that encourages research into different pedagogical techniques and to determine the most effective way of structuring STEM summer camps.


### How to Use This Project Site

This project site will serve as a repository for all of the materials and activities necessary to run a successful summer camp. You can download the repository as a .zip file. It will contain lectures, activities, documentation, and more for you to get started with your summer camp.
