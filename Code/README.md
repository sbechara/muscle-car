# Muscle Car
This repository holds all of the information necessary to build your own electromyogram controlled RC car!

## **POST CAMP SURVEY**
Please go to this link: https://goo.gl/forms/pume1Vk2j61by3nA2
to take the post camp survey! I would especially appreciate any comments you guys have (last question of the survey). Thanks again for being such a great and fun group!

## How to Use This Repository
Before you can get your completed muscle car using wireless, it is necessary to make sure that you have a good understanding of how the muscle sensors work and how to read from them and how your motors work and how to turn them. To help you, I have created different folders that contain little bits of different code.

### test-muscle-sensors Folder
This folder contains code that will allow you to simply read the sensor values coming from your muscle. This is necessary to make sure that you can "tune" your car to your muscle signal with your specific physiology.

### test-motors Folder
This folder contains code that will allow to run your Ardumoto motors and gives you a template to create autonomous programs. *Note: autonomous is a fancy way of saying, not human controlled*. This code will allow you to make sure that you understand how the motors work, how you can change their speed, etc.

### muscleCar-code Folder
This folder contains the final code that you will need to upload to your muscle car so that you can get it to work wirelessly! This is the final bits of code, so don't look through this folder until you have completed all other activities for the camp!
